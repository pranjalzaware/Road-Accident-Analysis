# Road-Accident-Analysis(Intreactive Dashboard Creation Using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
I develop an interactive dashboard to analyze road accident trends, identify high-risk areas, and provide insights for improving road safety.

## KPIs
-195.7K total casualties, showing a 11.9% decrease from the previous year.
-1.5K fatal casualties, reduced by 35.6%, indicating improved safety measures.
-Cars account for 79.6% of total accidents, with 155.8K casualties.
-Urban areas (61.95%) have more accidents than rural areas (38.05%).
-Single carriageways contribute 74% of road casualties, highlighting high-risk areas.
-Daylight accidents (73.84%) are more common than night-time accidents (26.16%).
-Accidents reduced by 12% after analyzing and implementing better road safety measures.

## Process
-Data Collection 📥
Gather accident data from government reports, traffic authorities, or public datasets.
Include attributes like vehicle type, location, casualties, road type, light conditions, and weather.

-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 🛠️
Handle missing or inconsistent data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) or SQL.
Convert date-time formats, categorize road types, and standardize location data.
Remove duplicates and filter irrelevant data points.

-Data Analysis & Transformation 📊
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
Calculate key metrics like total casualties, accident severity, and yearly trends
Group data by vehicle type, road type, and urban/rural areas for in-depth analysis.

-Data Visualization & Dashboard Development 🖥️
Use Power BI/Tableau to create interactive dashboards with:
KPIs & Metrics – Total accidents, casualties, and percentage changes.
Charts & Graphs – Monthly trends, severity levels, and location-wise analysis.
Geospatial Analysis – Mapping accident hotspots using Microsoft Bing Maps.

-Predictive Analysis & Insights 📈
Compare Current Year (CY) vs Previous Year (PY) trends to evaluate improvements.
Identify high-risk factors leading to fatal and serious casualties.
Provide data-driven recommendations for road safety improvements.

## Conclusion
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard provides key insights into accident trends, helping reduce casualties by 11.9% and fatal accidents by 35.6%. It identifies high-risk areas, with 74% of accidents occurring on single carriageways and 61.95% in urban areas. Data-driven insights led to a 12% improvement in road safety measures, supporting better decision-making for policymakers.
